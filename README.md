# Raspberry Pi SDK

C/C++ development framework for Raspberry pi

## About

The goal of this project is to create a framework for the Raspberry Pi 
that resembles an embedded system. While not technically a microcontroller, 
the Raspberry Pi has similar peripherals and performance constraints, such 
that it can be useful for prototyping embedded concepts. The API provided 
by this project is intended to emulate what is available in ESP or STM, so 
developers can build their projects with a better idea of how their apps 
would be implemented on an actual embedded board.
